        <h2>what</h2>
        <p>So what is pair programming anyway? Pair programming is a protocol for two people to develop code as a pair. First there's a check-in to see how each person is doing. Then the pair must choose who takes on each specific role - the driver or the navigator. The driver sits at the keyboard and enters the code. The navigator tells the driver what to enter. In this way the code is produced from a collaboration of both individuals.</p>

        <h2>why</h2>
        <p>So why should you pair program? Wouldn't it be faster to program alone? More than likely yes, at least in the short run. The problem is when you're dealing with a project over time. As that project grows in both scope and sequence, it becomes difficult to maintain by a single person. As soon as you need more than one person to work on a project, the benefits of pair programming start to really come through. It's helpful for more than one person to understand the code, it creates a system where errors can be caught on the fly, and it creates a sense of ownership and community on a project which is critical for its sustainability. In the long run, pair programming will save time when compared to individual programmers who only understand the parts of a project they worked on.<p>

      <section class="column-section" id="how-to-pp">
        <h2>how</h2>
        <p>So how can you pair program effectively? One key point is to understand how to follow the roles of driver and navigator. The driver should never enter code without first discussing it with the navigator. This is very difficult to do, especially in the beginning. It's critical to be strict about following the roles when first learning to establish those habits. Another key is to know who drives and who navigates. It's smoother if the driver has a strong syntactical knowledge of the language. The navigator must be able to communicate their ideas to another person verbally, so it helps if they can organize their thoughts in pseudocode. But again, it's important to switch roles when first learning, regardless of what's comfortable. With experience, you may find yourselves switching roles multiple times within a session. Finally, it's essential to do a proper check-in, especially with two people who don't know each other that well. Your ability to collaborate will always be deeply affected by your current disposition. A check-in helps ensure both people are starting on the right foot. In the end, the important thing is to make sure there's an equal distribution of the collaboration so that both people have ownership over the code that's produced.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>I was the only one signed up for my session, so I wasn't able to work on this challenge with a pair. I was asked to be both driver and navigator, so I did my best to verbalize out loud what I was thinking before I entered lines of code. I can imagine both hating pair programming and really enjoying it. I enjoy collaborating with others and I enjoy teaching, so in that way pair programming would be a fun experience for me. But if I'm on a deadline, I get a bit nervous and impatient, which would make me a bad partner. I think it has a lot to do with the personalities of the pair, so I can see why the check-in is so important. Your personality is deeply affected by your mood, so it's critical to start two people (in this case strangers) on the right foot. One thing that I imagine would be tough with pair programming are the aesthetic choices. For this website, I chose the red, green, and blue colors for the text in the columns because it looks cool and matches the nerdy programming theme (rgb color codes, plus I got the colors from the default syntax highlighting in Sublime Text 2). But it makes it harder to read. I imagine it would be difficult to resolve these kind of subjective choices depending on the person, so it's something I'll be watching out for to see what works best.</p>
